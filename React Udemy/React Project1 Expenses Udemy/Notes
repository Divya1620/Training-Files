React:-
-React.js is an JavaScript Library developed and maintained by Facebook.
-It is used to build interactive user interfaces.
-We can create Single Page Applications(SPA) with react.
-An SPA roads only once then partially uploads the page as per user request.
-With react we can built custom HTML elements.
-React is all about "Components".
-Some examples of applications created with react are- Facebook, Netflix, Airbnb, Instagram, New York Times.

Set up react:-
-For react we need 3 things node, npm and create-react project
-We create react project with the cmd-
npx create-react-app my-app(project name)
cd my-app
npm start

JSX:-
-JSX stands for JavaScript and XML.
-It is a JavaScript syntax extension that allows us to write js and HTML together in a react.

Components:- 
-A component is one of the core building blocks of react.
-It is an independent and reusable bit of code which divides UI into smaller pieces.
-Component cann be as tiny as a button and as large as entire page.
-We can split components into multiple components.

Props:-
-Props stands for Propertits.
-Props allow us to pass data from one component to other components as an argument.

State:-
-The State is a built-in react object that is used to contain data or information about the component.
-With state we can set and change values.
-Whenever the  state change, the component re-renders where the state is register.
const [stateName, setStateMethod] = useState(value);

Events:-
-Events are an function that is performed by an user.
-We have events like onClick, onChange and so on.
-We pass a function to trigger an action that is known as Event Handling.

Two Way Data Binding:-
-Two-way data binding refers to the synchronization of data between a component's state and it's UI elements.
-In 2 way binding the data flows in both directions.
-It means we just don't listen to changes but also pass a new value back into the input that is 2-way data binding in react.

Note:--
For onClick event we should pass--
-A function to events that should execute when an event occurs.

Passing Child-to-Parent components--
-We can accept a function via props and call it from inside the child component then trigger some action in the parent component (which passed the function).

Map method--
-It creates a new array and transform every element in the original array.

Keys--
-In react you should always add a key when mapping out lists of items.
