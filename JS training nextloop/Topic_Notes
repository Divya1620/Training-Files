**First Day Training- 27/03/2023**
1.How to run js- we can run it on browser, with live server or in vs code terminal.
-paste the html file's path on browser so our page will be displayed.
-for live server, first install the live server extension then click on go live or open with live server.
-for vs code terminal, you should have node install in your system then open vs code terminal & in the terminal write node then file name (ex.- node index.js) & it will run only js files.

2.How to add js-we can add js in 2 ways internally or externally.
-In Internal way,we add js either in head tag(before </head>) or in body tag(before </body>).
-In External way,we create an external file with .js extension & thn write our js code in that external file.

3.when we click on inspect & open the console so we have an option sources.In sources we have our files & folders & inside sources we can click on snippets & there we can create new file & run it there.

4.Variables- They are containers for storing data & values, they're of 3 types var, let & const.
-var is a global variable. we can redeclared it or reassigned it.
-let is a local variable. we can reassigned it but can't redeclared it.
-const have block scope & local variable. we can't redeclared or reassigned it & when we declare const at the same time we have to initialize it we can't do it later.

**Second Day- 28/03/2023**
1.Data Types- Data types describes the different type of data & they are string,number,boolean,null,undefined,array,object & to check which data type it is we can use typeof oprator for it.
-String is a data type which is written in single or double quotes.
-Number is a data type which is written without quotes or it can be written as with or without decimal.
-Boolean contains 2 values true & false.
-Null is supposed to be nothing it is falsy value & the typeof oprator return an object for null.
-Undefined means the value has not be assigned or the variable doesn't exist.
-Array is written in square braces[] & it can contain many values & the typeof oprator return an object for array.
-Object is written inside curly braces{} & it is a collection of key:value pairs.

2.Operators- Operators assign values to variable & add them together. They are arithmetic,comparison,logical,bitwise & assignment Operators.
-Arithmetic Operators such as addition+, substraction-, multiplication*, division/, modulous%, increment++, decrement--, exponentiation**.
-Comparison Operators such as greater than>, less than<, greater than or equal to>=, less than or equal to<=,
equal to==, not equal to!=, equal value &  equal type===, not equal value or not equal type!==.
-Logical Operators such as logical AND&&, logical OR||, logical NOT!.
-Assignment Operators such as =, +=, -=, *=,/= & so on.
